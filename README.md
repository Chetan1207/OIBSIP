# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Car price prediction is a machine learning project that involves predicting the price of cars based on several features such as company name, doornumber, mileage, engine specifications, and other factors. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on the given input features.

The project involved several stages, starting with data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The data was collected from various sources and involved a total of 205 observations with 26 variables. The data was then cleaned by removing missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the distribution of the variables, the relationship between different variables, and identify any patterns or trends. Feature engineering was then performed to transform the data into a suitable format for modeling. This involved handling categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, and removing highly correlated variables.

Several machine learning models were then trained on the preprocessed data to predict the car prices. The models evaluated included linear regression, Lasso regression, ElasticNet regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and XGBoost regression. The performance of each model was evaluated using the R-squared value and mean squared error.
